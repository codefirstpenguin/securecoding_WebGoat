Dear WebGoat Learner

You can simply open "index.htm" to enjoy learning Webgoat.

Alternatively, you can launch our included python web server movie-server.py to enjoy learning from your browser, possibly with your team players on LAN.

As we said, there are some lessons that have NOT been prepared. These are meant for your self-experiment and exercise.

DO NOT spend your precious time recreating your own WebGoat movies in YouTube/Vimeo. 
Instead, with knowledge you'll gain from these movies, pentest open-source applications to contribute for their stronger security as well as to lift up your pentest skills.

Let us know (404@yehg.net) if you spot any broken links.
